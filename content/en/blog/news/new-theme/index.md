We were having a hard time fitting in business models, a book, news, and other
content that didn't seem to fit in any of these categories, and so we found
a new theme,  [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) that allows us much
more freedom to do that!

 - [Documentation](/docs/): Is found under the "docs" base, with an easy to use navigation bar on the left, and links to edit or ask a question on the right.
 - [Blog](/blog/): is what you are reading now! We can both write news posts, and announce new releases.
 - [Community](/community/) is a resource to help you easily find community links.
